/**
 * Sample Mouse Maze Puzzle.
 * The mouse(M) is positioned in a cell of the maze.
 * The mouse sequentially moves to open cells until the mouse reaches the exit cell E.
 * An open cell is marked by 0.
 * A closed cell is marked by 1.
 * by : <MAYO Kenneth Charles P.>
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize the maze with a 2D array of characters, where '1' represents walls, '0' represents open cells,
 *    'M' is the starting position of the mouse, and 'E' is the exit.
 * 2. Search for the entry point 'M' (mouse position) and the exit point 'E' in the maze.
 *    Save their coordinates for later use.
 * 3. Display the initial maze and explain the rules (mouse has to find the exit through open cells marked by '0').
 * 4. Initialize a stack (mazeStack) to store cells to visit during exploration.
 * 5. Set the current cell to the entry point (mouse position).
 * 6. While the current cell is not equal to the exit:
 *    a. Mark the current cell as visited if itâ€™s not the starting point by setting its value to '.'.
 *    b. Push neighboring open cells (up, down, left, right) onto the stack using the pushUnvisited method:
 *       - Only open cells ('0') or the exit ('E') are pushed onto the stack.
 *    c. If the stack is empty, display failure (no path to the exit) and stop.
 *    d. Otherwise, pop the next cell from the stack and set it as the current cell.
 *    e. Display the updated maze after each step, and wait for user input to continue.
 * 7. If the current cell matches the exit, display success and the final state of the maze.
 * 8. End the program.
 *
 * A output example of the program
 *
 * 111111
 * 1100E1
 * 100111
 * 100001
 * 1100M1
 * 101111
 *
 * The above figure shows a maze where a mouse M is in.
 * The Mouse M should move to exhaustively find the Exit cell E
 * A cell marked 0 is an open cell, a cell marked by 1 is a closed cell
 * Keep pressing the enter key until success or failure is reached.
 * Find the way out.
